- **Modularity**: Designed with a modular architecture, enabling easy integration with other systems.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for both installation and usage.

## Installation

To get started with Any-SSR, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awogbemibenjamin/Any-SSR.git
cd Any-SSR
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using Any-SSR. The main script is located in the `src` directory. Run the following command to execute the program:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

For additional options and configurations, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.

## Download Releases

You can download the latest release of Any-SSR [here](https://github.com/awogbemibenjamin/Any-SSR/releases). 

Make sure to download the necessary files and execute them as described in the installation section.

## Examples

Here are some examples to help you understand how to use Any-SSR effectively:

### Example 1: Basic Usage

```python
from any_ssr import RLSModel

model = RLSModel()
model.fit(data)
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```

### Example 2: Advanced Configuration

```python
from any_ssr import RLSModel

model = RLSModel(alpha=0.9, lambda_=0.1)
model.fit(data)
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```

### Visualization

To visualize the results, you can use libraries like Matplotlib. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(predictions)
plt.title('Predictions from Any-SSR')
plt.xlabel('Sample Index')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Value')
plt.show()
```

## FAQs

### What is Any-SSR?

Any-SSR is a framework for applying Recursive Least Squares in continual learning scenarios, particularly for large language models.

### How does it work?

The framework uses RLS to update model parameters dynamically as new data arrives, allowing for effective learning without retraining from scratch.

### Can I use Any-SSR for my own projects?

Yes, you can integrate Any-SSR into your own projects as long as you comply with the licensing terms.

### What are the requirements?

You will need Python 3.6 or higher and the libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Where can I find more information?

Visit our [documentation](docs/) for more details on setup, usage, and examples.
